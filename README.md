# Dual Cycle

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of the experiment is to demonstrate the change in P-v graph of Dual Cycle as the pressure and volume variables change, as well as calculate and display the heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, and efficiency of the Dual cycle. <br>
