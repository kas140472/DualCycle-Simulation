#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. In the simulation window, the Dual cycle graph and the piston are displayed.

4. Move the sliders’ knobs to vary the pressures P1 and P3, the volumes v1 and v3 and gamma. P1 can be varied from 0.1 to 0.25 kPa. P3 can be varied from 1.1 to 1.5 kPa. V1 can be varied from 6 to 7.5 m3. V2 can be varied from 2 to 3.5 m3. V4 can be varied from 4 to 5 m3. T1 can be varied from 323 to 252 K.<br>
