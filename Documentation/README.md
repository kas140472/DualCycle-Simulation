<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

 The main objective of the experiment is to demonstrate the change in P-v graph of Dual Cycle as the pressure and volume variables change, as well as calculate and display the heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, and efficiency of the Dual cycle. 

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Dual cycle is a thermodynamics cycle developed by the engineer Gustav Trinkler. It is a combination of the Otto cycle used for SI engines and the Diesel cycle used for CI engines. In this cycle, the combustion takes place partially over an isochoric process and partially over an isobaric process to ensure that the fuel combustion takes place completely.
<br><br>
The various processes involved are explained below:<br>
<li>Isentropic compression phase, where the gas is compressed by the piston as it goes up.</li>
<li>Constant volume heat addition, where the gas partially undergoes combustion. The pressure variation in this process is known as the explosion ratio.</li>
<li>Constant pressure heat addition, where the combustion of the air-fuel mixture continues to take place. In this process, the piston moves towards V4 doing work. This is the power stroke.</li>
<li>Isentropic expansion phase, where the gas is expanded adiabatically in a reversible manner as the piston moves towards the bottom dead centre, and the gas does work on the surroundings. This also contributes to the power stroke.</li>
<li>Constant volume heat rejection phase, where the heat is rejected to the surroundings as the piston is at the bottom dead centre. The exhaust gases escape through the exhaust valve.</li>
<br>
In this experiment, the Dual cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change.
