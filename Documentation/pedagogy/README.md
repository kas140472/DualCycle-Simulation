#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Experimentation

<u>About the Experiment:</u><br>

Dual cycle is a thermodynamics cycle developed by the engineer Gustav Trinkler. It is a combination of the Otto cycle used for SI engines and the Diesel cycle used for CI engines. In this cycle, the combustion takes place partially over an isochoric process and partially over an isobaric process to ensure that the fuel combustion takes place completely.

The various processes involved are explained below:

1-2 - This is the isentropic compression phase, where the gas is compressed by the piston as it goes up.

2-3 - This is the constant volume heat addition, where the gas partially undergoes combustion. The pressure variation in this process is known as the explosion ratio.

3-4 - This is the constant pressure heat addition, where the combustion of the air-fuel mixture continues to take place. In this process, the piston moves towards V4 doing work. This is the power stroke.

4-5 - This is the isentropic expansion phase, where the gas is expanded adiabatically in a reversible manner as the piston moves towards the bottom dead centre, and the gas does work on the surroundings. This also contributes to the power stroke.

5-1 - This is the constant volume heat rejection phase, where the heat is rejected to the surroundings as the piston is at the bottom dead centre. The exhaust gases escape through the exhaust valve.

In this experiment, the Dual cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>

The experiment consists of the Dual cycle P-V graph. All the buttons and parameters control the right corner of the frame. The variable panel contains sliders for the pressures P1 and P3 and the volumes V1, V2 and V4 and the temperature T1.

The setup consists of a graph that depicts the Dual cycle. A legend at the top indicates the processes involved in each of the curves.

By changing the various parameters, the P-V graph changes.

1. The initial P1 is taken as 0.1 kPa.<br>
2. The initial P3 is taken as 1.1 kPa.<br>
3. The initial V1 is taken as 6 m<sup>3</sup>/kg.<br>
4. The initial V2 is taken as 2 m<sup>3</sup>/kg.<br>
5. The initial V4 is taken as 4 m<sup>3</sup>/kg.<br>
6. The initial T1 is taken as 323 K.<br>
7. P1 is varied from 0.1 to 0.25 kPa using a slider.<br>
8. P3 is varied from 1.1 to 1.5 kPa using a slider.<br>
9. V1 is varied from 6 to 7.5 m<sup>3</sup>/kg using a slider.<br>
10. V2 is varied from 2 to 3.5 m<sup>3</sup>/kg using a slider.<br>
11. V4 is varied from 4 to 4.5 m<sup>3</sup>/kg using a slider.<br>
12. T1 is varied from 323 to 353 K using the slider.<br>

Change the parameters of the system to understand the behaviour of the Dual cycle.
